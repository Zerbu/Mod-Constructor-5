	<String Key="BlockedEmotions">Blocked Emotions</String>
	<String Key="BlockedEmotionsNotice">Sims with the trait will not be able to receive buffs with these emotions. Please beware that this can interfere with gameplay. Goals that require Sims to be in a specific emotion will be impossible to complete, and buffs that have gameplay modifying effects will not work.</String>
	<String Key="SocialInteractionsNotice">These social interactions will be available to Sims who have the trait or buff.</String>
	<String Key="TraitSetupActionsNotice">These actions are applied when a Sim is first placed in the world or when a trait is added through gameplay. This is intended for giving Sims a "head start" on life, for example setting Character Values from Parenthood. These actions are not always guaranteed to run and will not be undone when a trait is removed (such as through the Re-Traiting Potion or cheats).</String>
	<String Key="MixerinteractionsNotice">Mixer interactions are "idles" that can be performed while the Sim has the trait or buff. By default, these interactions are hidden from the player and can only be performed autonomously. A common use of these interactions is to use lock out times to run an action at a random interval (emotional buffs added by EA traits, like "Feeling Sad", are added using Mixer Interactions). Warning: Setting the lock out time too low can cause simulation lag.</String>
	<String Key="TraitBuffReplacementsNotice">When Sims are meant to receive the original buff, Sims with the trait will receive a replacement instead. WARNING: This can prevent parts of the game that expect the original buff from working properly. Because of this, it is recommended you avoid replacing buffs that are tied to gameplay (for example: pregnancy buffs, buffs that appear when Sims have low Needs, role buffs, festival buffs, etc). In such cases, an alternative would be to use an action to have a buff spawn in addition to the original, not instead of.</String>
	<String Key="AddReplacement">Add Replacement</String>
	<String Key="BroadcastersNotice">Broadcasters are used to add buffs or run actions when in the proximity of another Sim. For example, a Sim who is interested in vampires could get an Energized buff around vampires. Effects can also be applied to the receiver; for example, a bully Sim could cause all other Sims to get a Scared buff.

Note: Conditions are applied to the receiver, not the sender.</String>
	<String Key="CommoditiesNotice">Commodities are used to make Sims autonomously desire to perform certain interactions. In this section, you can add commodities from existing traits, emotions and other EA resources. You can also set the score so that a Sim will desire interactions more or less than normal. Commodities can also do other things for more advanced modders.</String>
	<String Key="TraitActionsNotice">These actions will run every 10 Sim minutes (unless configured in Advanced Settings). A common use is to check the conditions of a Sim (such as which interaction they're currently performing or which venue they're in) and apply a buff based on those conditions.</String>
	<String Key="EffectiveSkillModifiers">Effective Skill Modifiers</String>
	<String Key="EffectiveSkillModifiersNotice">These modifiers cause the game to treat the Sim as if their skill is higher or lower in certain contexts. For example, if a Sim is at level 3 of the Cooking skill, and has an effective Cooking skill modifier of 2, they'll cook at a quality as if they were at level 5. Not all parts of the game are effected by effective skill modifiers.</String>

	<String Key="Needs">Needs</String>
	<String Key="NeedDecay">Need Decay</String>
	<String Key="NeedIncrease">Need Increase</String>
	<String Key="NeedIncreaseNotice">These modifiers effect how quickly a need will increase while performing an interaction. For example, a Sim with a positive Energy multiplier will need less sleep before their Energy fills up.</String>
	<String Key="Relationships">Relationships</String>
	<String Key="RelationshipTrackIncreaseMultipliers">Relationship Track Increase Multipliers</String>
	<String Key="RelationshipTrackIncreaseMultipliersNotice">These modifiers effect how quickly a Sim will build relationships.</String>
	<String Key="RelationshipTrackDecreaseMultipliers">Relationship Track Decrease Multipliers</String>
	<String Key="RelationshipTrackDecreaseMultipliersNotice">These modifiers effect how much a Sim's relationship score will go down when performing negative interactions. It has no effect on how much it will decay naturally.</String>
	<String Key="EmotionsandBuffs">Emotions and Buffs</String>
	<String Key="EmotionWeightMultipliers">Emotion Weight Multipliers</String>
	<String Key="EmotionWeightMultipliersNotice">These modifiers effect the strength of all buffs with a certain emotion. For example, a modifier of 2 for Angry will make it so that a single +1 Angry buff will be treated like two +1 Angry buffs.</String>
	<String Key="BuffDecayMultipliers">Buff Decay Multipliers</String>
	<String Key="BuffDecayMultipliersNotice">These modifiers will cause all buffs in a certain category (generally, buffs with a certain emotion) decay faster or slower.</String>

  <String Key="ActionTrigger">Action Trigger</String>
  <String Key="ActionTriggerNotice">Action Triggers can be used to run an action set when a Sim completes a certain objective. Example: Sims can become Confident from successfully performing social interactions. By default, action triggers are applied to all Sims, but you can define conditions in the action set.

This feature requires the player to have "Script Mods Allowed" enabled in the game settings.

!!IMPORTANT!! The actions will be triggered EVERY TIME the game checks if the objective is complete, not just when the Sim first enters the condition. Example: If the objective is set to "Money Condition", then as long as the Sim meets the threshold, it will be triggered every time the Sim's amount of money is changed (which tells the game to check re-check the condition), even if the Sim already met the threshold previously. Because of this, Action Triggers work best with "fire and forget" objectives, like performing interactions.
