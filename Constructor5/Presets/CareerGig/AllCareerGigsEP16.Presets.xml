  <Preset Label="Find what became of Alice's family. (questGig_EP17World_AliceTree_AliceQuest)" Value="386483" />
  <Preset Label="Scared to face the Reaper? Some of us were tricked into this ghostly existence. Not me, but spirits I know. They were made promises that weren't kept by an oversized house plant. I'd like you to fulfill on that promise and maybe pay a visit to the party responsible. Just don't eat the cake. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Esther_Cake)" Value="388231" />
  <Preset Label="Things are a bit odd around here. Mysterious circumstances cover these grounds like fresh fallen snow. Could you take a look around? See what you find. Maybe check out that ghastly merchant who seems to have things that don't belong to him. Let me know what you discover and I'll part ways with my card. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Nyon_Family)" Value="388232" />
  <Preset Label="You're going to have to prove to me that you're strong enough to handle this favor. It's not easy being dead. But there's an essence in all of us and that is what I seek. I'm not asking you to meet the Reaper, but a temporary dip into the afterlife won't be bothersome if you really want that card. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Esther_Haunt)" Value="388238" />
  <Preset Label="Estranged or just strange? Grim is as mystifying as the Baleful Bog itself! But I'm no fool, I know he'd be around more if he could, but he's got a business to run. Could you do me a favor? Deliver this for me. It's our own inside joke, &quot;You never gnome when death will come!&quot; Funny, right? (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Nyon_Grim)" Value="388239" />
  <Preset Label="Looking into the hood of a Reaper can really make you reevaluate what matters most. Maybe you understand, maybe you don't. But you look like the type who can lead the way. Earn your keep in this community by helping me sustain some family joy, and I might be willing to part with my treasure. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Ekade_DeadEnd)" Value="393776" />
  <Preset Label="Love does not cease when death takes hold, but sometimes meaning does. Ghosts get lost, and it can be up to the living to reignite their inner flame. If you see a ghost, show some kindness! Let me know what you find, I'm dying to know what makes them stay. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Ekade_GhostlyMatters)" Value="393777" />
  <Preset Label="Have you ever honored the dead? Seasons come and go, much like ourselves, but keeping memories alive allows us to bask in their warmth once again. Give it a try, but if anyone asks, don't tell anyone I said that. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Zelmira_AltarToAltar)" Value="393798" />
  <Preset Label="Science claims to have death all figured out, but I think it's much more magical than that. You don't feel the same? Why don't you compare the two. Let's see what wisdom you can conjure up. (questGig_TarotNPCHelp_Zelmira_BringHerToLife)" Value="393799" />
